        <p><strong>5-day retreat in the south of Spain.</strong></p>
        <p>A gathering for people who know each other from Twitter to hang out and enjoy the exquisite pleasures of being surrounded by likeminded weirdos with high openness and no particular objectives besides weaving social fabric. <strong>And it's Rich's birthday!</strong></p>


        <h2 id="whennbsp">When</h2>
        <p>Thursday 30th November - Monday 4th December 2023<br />
        (plus an option to stay longer)</p>

        <h2 id="accomodation">Accomodation</h2>
        <p>We're staying in a big old Andalusian farmhouse with a courtyard, balconies, a swimming pool, and views  over the Granada countryside out towards the Sierra Nevada mountain range.</p>
        <p>There are 10 bedrooms, 7 bathrooms, 3 living rooms and 3 kitchens. So we'll fit about 20 of us, depending on how many people share a bed.</p>
        <p>It's a 200 year old house that's been recently renovated so it's a pretty lush place.</p>

        <h2 id="food">Food</h2>
        <p>Every effort will be made to provide healthy and filling food for everyone. Dietary requirements must be included as part of your booking. Guests will be expected to participate in cooking and cleaning.</p>

        <h2 id="activities">Activities</h2>
        <p>While the "official" structured events tend to be very light touch the gathering is designed around communal living, with cooking and cleaning for each other being the main activity. Once the chores are done, there is a great deal of Unstructured Time for unwinding, relaxing, hanging out, chilling, and seeing what magic comes from a few day's intensive conversation.</p>
        <p>There will be an opening ceremony and a closing ceremony, and we'll generate a timetable of activities in an "unconference" style - participants both suggest and lead the events they want to see, so there will be plenty of activities to participate in, from lockpicking to clowning, from Fight Club to Epistemics.</p>

        <h2 id="payment">Payment</h2>
        <p>Tickets:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>€500/ea for the "premium" rooms (4 tickets left)</li>
          <li>€400/ea for the "economy" rooms (3 tickets left)</li>
          <li>€400/ea for couples / anyone that shares a double bed (4 tickets left)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Economy rooms will have up to 3 beds in a room, with a bathroom that is shared between several rooms. Premium rooms have nicer features like more privacy or an en suite bathroom. </p>
        <p>Your ticket covers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>4 nights accomodation</li>
          <li>food and booze and treats</li>
          <li>1 priceless improvement to your wellbeing</li>
          <li>bedding is included but please bring your own towel</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If the price is out of reach but you'd love to join us let us know on the registration form and we'll see what we can do. On the other hand, if you're willing to contribute extra money to support discounted tickets for others, let us know when you register.</p>

        <h2 id="extended-stay">Extended stay</h2>
        <p>Rich &amp; Nati are living in this house throughout the winter. So we're happy to have a few guests stay for the week following RichFest. You can indicate your interest in this on the registration form and we'll be in touch.</p>

        <h2 id="travel">Travel</h2>
        <p>The venue is El Almendrillo in Fuente del Conde. (<a target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/PB8LJN2dsfeJvkQe6">Google Maps link.)</a></p>
        <p><strong>Driving</strong><br />
        Google Maps may send you on a crazy impassable path. The correct access is via the slightly less crazy driveway <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ci7fGLZoXBvrkMrZ9">that starts at the village church</a>.</p>
        <p>The house is about an hour's drive from Malaga Airport. Let us know if you're willing to rent a car at Malaga Airport and help shuttle other people to the event. We'll cover the cost.</p>
        <p><strong>Flying</strong><br />
        Fly to Malaga airport, take the airport train (12 min) to the central station (Málaga María Zambrano), then take the fast train to Antequera (20 min). We'll arrange transport from Antequera (it's a 30 min drive to the house).</p>
        <p><strong>Train</strong><br />
        There's a fast train Madrid to Antequera.</p>

        <h2 id="other-bits">Other bits</h2>
        <p>If there's anything we should know so we can host you well, reach out. The house is unfortunately not equipped for <strong>wheelchair users</strong>. If you have other <strong>accessibility</strong> needs, let us know and we'll do what we can. </p>
        <p>Sad to say, this event is not going to be well equipped for <strong>kids</strong>. Hopefully RichFest2 will be bigger and better and we can accomodate families next time.</p>

        <h2 id="refund-policy">Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>Once you buy a ticket you cannot get a refund. Tickets may be exchanged with another member of tpot up until the week before the event. BOTH THE SELLER AND BUYER must notify the organising team of the old name of the booking and the new name, plus any dietary requirements for the new ticketholder by email at least one week before the event. </p>
